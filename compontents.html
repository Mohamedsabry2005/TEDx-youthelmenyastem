                              High school. Some heard this word now and remember their happy times. Many people heard
                              it and remembered the worst memories. It can be fun for some, because it can
                              psychologically destroy people from all the pressures of subjects they study from
                              subjects that need intensive research and study. Many people are lost at that point in
                              life and don't know where to go or what to do in order to achieve what they want.

                              What do you expect when going to one of many TEDx Events?
                              Of course, one expects various activities and various speakers on various topics
                              surrounding one concept.

                              <br>
                              Also breaks between talks and sessions are filled with joyous activities and such people
                              like Steven Abadir!

                              event, improves the atmosphere of the event instead of it being all around our
                              scientific topic and can reach the point of boredom occasionally ✨
                              "Let's beat the beat." 💣
